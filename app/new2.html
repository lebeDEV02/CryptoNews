					<a class="green" href="https:/blockchain.com" target="_blank">Blockchain.com</a> has announced that it
					has <a class="green"
						href="https://medium.com/blockchain/blockchain-com-raised-120m-strategic-growth-round-led-by-macro-investors-84488f4a0913"
						target="_blank">raised</a> a $120 million funding
					round. The company develops a
					popular
					cryptocurrency wallet as well as an exchange, an explorer and more.
				</p>

				<p>
					Moore Strategic Ventures, Kyle Bass, Access Industries, Rovida Advisors, Lightspeed Venture Partners, GV,
					Lakestar,
					Eldridge and other unnamed investors participated in today’s funding round. Overall, the company has
					raised more than
					$190 million since its creation.
				</p>

				<p>
					Originally named Blockchain.info, the company started off as a blockchain explorer. An explorer lets you
					enter the hash
					of any transaction that occurs on the bitcoin blockchain to get more information about the amount, fees,
					number of
					confirmations as well as the wallet addresses of the sender and the receiver. Over time, explorers
					started adding
					support for more blockchains and more types of data.
				</p>

				<p>
					Blockchain.com then built an open-source bitcoin wallet — it now supports more cryptocurrencies and
					stablecoins. The
					company’s wallet is a noncustodial wallet, which means that you’re in control of your private keys. Other
					noncustodial
					wallets include Coinbase Wallet, Argent, ZenGo, etc.
				</p>

				<p>
					Many crypto users choose to buy bitcoins on an exchange and leave them on the exchange account. In that
					case, you don’t
					control the wallet as the exchange takes care of keeping your crypto assets safe for you. Custodial
					wallets include
					Coinbase.com, Binance, Kraken, etc.
				</p>

				<p>
					There are some advantages and disadvantages with each solution. If an exchange gets hacked or somebody
					gets your login
					information through phishing, your assets aren’t safe on a custodial wallet.
				</p>

				<p>
					If you lose your private key, you can’t access your noncustodial wallet. Blockchain.com and other
					noncustodial wallet
					providers have found ways to mitigate the risk of losing access to your wallet by backing up some
					information.
				</p>

				<p>
					More recently, Blockchain.com has launched its own exchange so that wallet users can trade assets more
					easily. It now
					also offers services to institutional investors so that they can get started with cryptocurrencies.
					Services include
					order executions, custody, lending, OTC transactions, etc.
				</p>

				<p>
					Blockchain.com has also shared some metrics. People have created 65 million wallets on the company’s
					website or using
					the mobile apps. Since 2012, 28% of bitcoin transactions have been sent or received by a
					Blockchain.com-managed wallet.
