				Tech Tent: Facebook v Australia - two sides to the story

				<p>
					The battle between the Australian government and the tech giants over a law which would make them pay for
					news content
					has been rumbling on for a while.
				</p>

				<p>But Facebook's move to ban all Australian news content from its platform has taken the conflict to a
					whole new level.</p>

				<p>
					One of Rupert Murdoch's newspapers described it as "an act of war". But others see the actions of
					Australia's
					politicians as being an outrage against the principle of net neutrality.
				</p>

				<p>
					This week's Tech Tent podcast asks whether Mark Zuckerberg overplayed his hand, making it more likely
					that other
					countries will follow Australia's lead.
				</p>

				<p>
					'They botched it'
					If Facebook's founder thought that his bold move to impose a news blackout in one country would make
					politicians around
					the world rethink how they regulate his company, he may have been right.

					The problem is that they now seem even more determined to clip its wings.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now other countries which do not see Facebook as a good citizen may not go as far as Australia in
					demanding that tech
					firms pay up just for the privilege of sharing a news link.
				</p>

				<p>
					But many governments, concerned about how their newspapers have seen advertising revenues melt away in
					the online era,
					may now feel it's time to show they can also be tough on the tech giants.
				</p>

				<p>
					There is, of course, another side to this story.

					Even amongst Facebook's critics, not everyone is convinced that Australia has got the right approach.
