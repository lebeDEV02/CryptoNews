					Graphics card-maker Nvidia says it will deliberately reduce the efficiency of its latest card by 50% when
					it is used to
					mine the crypto-currency Ethereum.
				</p>

				<p>
					Crypto-currency enthusiasts have contributed to a shortage of graphics cards by snapping up supplies to
					use for
					non-gaming purposes.
				</p>

				<p>Nvidia said it had intervened to make sure its products "end up in the hands of gamers".</p>

				<p>
					The great graphics card shortage of 2020 (and 2021)
					How do crypto-currencies work?
					Bitcoin consumes 'more electricity than Argentina'
					Graphics cards are also popular with crypto-currency investors, who can use them for processing
					transactions and
					generating bitcoins, in a process known as mining.
				</p>

				<p>
					Many miners build rigs using several graphics cards at a time to produce a powerful machine dedicated to
					mining
					crypto-currency, rather than gaming.
				</p>

				<p>
					For this to be economical, the rig must generate more in bitcoins than the cost of the hardware and the
					electricity it
					uses to run.
				</p>

				<p>
					What has Nvidia done?
					Nvidia said the software for its forthcoming GeForce RTX 3060 card will limit how efficiently it can
					process Ethereum
					transactions by about 50%.
