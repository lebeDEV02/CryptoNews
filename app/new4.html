					Crypto payments platform BitPay has settled with the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets
					Control (OFAC)
					on charges of over 2,000 apparent sanctions violations.
				</p>

				<p>
					According to an enforcement notice published on Feb. 18, BitPay will pay $507,375 on allegations it
					allowed
					individuals
					in sanctioned locations like Ukraine’s Crimea region, Cuba, North Korea, Sudan, Iran and Syria to
					transact
					with people
					in the U.S., in apparent violation of U.S. sanctions law. Roughly $129,000 in cryptocurrencies were
					transacted between
					2013 and 2018.
				</p>

				<p>
					The company knew it was facilitating transactions for individuals in sanctioned regions because it had
					location
					information and IP addresses, OFAC claimed.
					Under the charges, BitPay could have faced a maximum fine of over $600 million, but OFAC took into
					consideration some
					mitigating factors, the enforcement notice said. These include that BitPay implemented compliance
					controls,
					employee
					training, launched an identification service, blocked IP addresses in sanctioned regions and took a
					number
					of other
					steps to prevent it from facilitating such transactions in future. BitPay cooperated with OFAC as the
					agency
					investigated the charges.
				</p>

				<p>
					“BitPay failed to exercise due caution or care for its sanctions compliance obligations when it allowed
					persons in
					sanctioned jurisdictions to transact with BitPay’s merchants using digital currency for approximately
					five
					years, even
					though BitPay had sufficient information to screen those customers,” the notice said.
				</p>

				<p>
					The notice warned that cryptocurrency companies must abide by OFAC regulations and monitor for possible
					sanctions risks.
					The Treasury Department watchdog has published a framework for companies to use as part of that mission.
