				Clubhouse downloads double in two weeks, analytics firm
				says
			</h1>

					App Annie reports that the app saw global downloads grow from 3.5 million to 8.1 million between 1 and 16
					February.
				</p>

				<p>The invite-only app has surged in popularity amid appearances by some high-profile celebrities.</p>

				<p>
					But that popularity has also seen the firm attract significant criticism.
					The growth has happened despite the restrictions of Clubhouse's model: it is only available for iPhones,
					and each user
					is only able to invite a few others.
				</p>

				<p>
					About 2.6 million of the recent downloads were in the United States, App Annie says in its report, but
					there was also a
					wide spread around the world.
				</p>

				<p>
					Part of the demand may have been fuelled by the appearance of technology figures such as Elon Musk and
					Mark Zuckerberg -
					and Facebook is now rumoured to be working on a similar product to compete.
				</p>

				<p> However, download numbers may not be an accurate indicator of the number of actual users.</p>

				<p>The app can be downloaded from the Apple App Store without actually having the invite needed to use it.
				</p>

				<p>
					Clubhouse is encouraging users to download the app anyway - because doing so allows new users to reserve
					their username
					for the future.
				</p>

				<p>
					Usernames can be a hot commodity on leading social networks, where competition for real names - or short,
					snappy ones -
					can be intense.
				</p>

				<p>Clubhouse does not release user numbers itself, but some estimates place the number of users at more than
					six million.</p>
