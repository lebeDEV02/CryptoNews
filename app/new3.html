					Billionaire <a class="green" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk" target="_blank">Elon
						Musk </a>defended Tesla Inc.’s $1.5 billion Bitcoin investment on Twitter,
					calling the
					cryptocurrency a
					“less dumb” version of cash.
				</p>

				<p>
					“When fiat currency has negative real interest, only a fool wouldn’t look elsewhere,” Musk said in a
					reference to the
					sub-zero returns on cash caused by negative-yielding debt. The comments pushed Bitcoin to a record on
					Friday, with
					prices climbing above $53,000.
				</p>
				<p>
					“Having some Bitcoin, which is simply a less dumb form of liquidity than cash, is adventurous enough for
					an
					S&P 500
					company,” Musk wrote, adding that Tesla’s decision to buy Bitcoin doesn’t directly reflect his opinion.
					Musk’s posts were in response to remarks by Binance Holdings Ltd.’s chief Changpeng Zhao. In a Bloomberg
					Television
					interview, Zhao wondered why Tesla bought Bitcoin if he’s so “gung-ho” on Dogecoin. Musk said he’s an
					engineer, not an
					investor, and doesn’t own any publicly traded stock besides Tesla.
