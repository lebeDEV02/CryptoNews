					Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder and technological whiz turned philanthropist, may not be a fan of
					bitcoin and
					digital-assets.
				</p>

				<p>
					Asked during an interview published on Thursday with The Wall Street Journal what technological
					advancement
					the world
					could do without, Gates had this to say:
				</p>

				<p>
					“The way cryptocurrency works today allows for certain criminal activities. It’d be good to get rid of
					that,” he quickly
					added: “I probably should have said bio weapons. That’s a really bad thing.”
				</p>

					enthusiast
					but his remarks may simply suggest that he feels that cryptocurrencies are prone to abuse by swindlers
					and
					in
					money-laundering schemes—a common criticism of the decentralized digital asset that was created in 2009.
				</p>

				<p>
					During a CNBC interview that aired on Thursday, Gates adopted a more moderate stance, describing his
					views
					on bitcoin as
					“neutral.”
				</p>

				<p>
					“I don’t own bitcoin, I’m not short bitcoin, so I’ve taken a neutral view,” he said in the interview that
					aired on
					CNBC’s “Sqawk Box” show.
				</p>

				<p>
					“I do think moving money into a more digital form and getting transaction costs down, that’s something
					the
					Gates
					Foundation does in developing countries,” he added.
				</p>

				<p>
					“Bitcoin can go up and down just based on the mania or whatever the views are and I don’t have a way of
					predicting how
					that will progress,” he said.
